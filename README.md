# Static website


## Description 
During my time learning AWS, I gained hands-on experience with several AWS services, which I applied to building a website. To host the website, I utilized AWS S3 for storage, which allowed me to store and retrieve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To manage the DNS settings for the website, I used AWS Route 53, which provided reliable and scalable DNS services. Additionally, I used AWS CloudFront for content delivery network (CDN) caching, which helped to improve the website's performance and reduce latency.

To automate the deployment process, I leveraged AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This enabled me to automatically build, test, and deploy changes to the website whenever new code was pushed to the repository, increasing the efficiency of the development process.

Overall, by utilizing these AWS services, I was able to build and deploy a scalable and reliable website that met the needs of my project.
